## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

I made two arrays of all the first and last names possible to get generated. I then created two variables that turn the values of those name indexes into numbers and add them together. After that I took the sum of the indexes minus 3 % first name array. Then I took that answer and put it into a variable called first name. I redid those previous steps to create a last name. I then put the first and last name into the innerText of h2 element tags.

## Lessons Learned:

the select tag allows you to do a drop down list of option items.
